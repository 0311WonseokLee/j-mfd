# J-MFD: Japanese Moral Foundations Dictionary

# Overview
Moral Foundations Dictionary ([MFD](http://moralfoundations.org/sites/default/files/files/downloads/moral%20foundations%20dictionary.dic)) is a list of English words related to each of five moral foundations (i.e., Harm, Fairness, Ingroup, Authority, and Purity) and morality in general, used to measure morality from written texts. In order to analyze Japanese texts in the same framework of [Moral Foundations Theory](http://moralfoundations.org/), we developed a Japanese version of MFD (J-MFD) based on the original version by using two online linguistic resources and two corpora with the aid of computational methods. The methodological details are described in the following paper.

The J-MFD ("[J-MFD_2017.dic](https://github.com/soramame0518/j-mfd/blob/master/J-MFD_2017.dic)") and a word segmentation program ("[word_segmentation.py](https://github.com/soramame0518/j-mfd/blob/master/word_segmentation.py)") used to segment Japanese sentences into words are publicly available under [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT/). If you find problems, please let us know via. "[issues](https://github.com/soramame0518/j-mfd/issues)" function on this page. We will use that information for future updates.
